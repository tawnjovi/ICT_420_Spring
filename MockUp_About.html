<h2>Welcome to Art Gallery</h2>
<p>
Art Gallery was established by the late Pete Casso, MFA, to provide opportunities to artists entering the global art market. Mr. Casso was a visionary who founded the gallery on the principle that all artists benefit from having their artwork promoted by a professional gallery. Located in the heart of the famous Art district, Art Gallery occupies the ground floor of 530 East 4th Street. The gallery is frequented by art lovers looking to find and buy original artwork. </p>
